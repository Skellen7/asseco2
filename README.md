## Idea
### Story
Imagine a situation... 4 pm, you're laying on a sofa watching your favourite Netflix TV series. Suddenly, a phone rings. Thought it's really hard to move your arm, you answer the phone. "Did you take out the trash, honey?" "Of course, sunshine" - you answer, looking at te pile of garbage laying next to the door. If only something could save you from your misery... Oh wait! A few taps on a phone and you get rid of your stinky problem!
Imagine another situation. You're young, full of energy and your friend invites you to a party. And SHE will be there! But, you look at your wallet and oh boy! It's empty! If only something could save you from your misery... Oh wait! A few taps on a phone and you can earn some extra bucks. All you have to do is to take out your lazy neighbour's trash while taking away yours. 

### Let's go into details
Our plan is to design a responsive web application that will work kind of like a platform for odd jobs. Users will be able both to post and take any kind of odd jobs. If you want to earn some extra money, you can explore the map of your nearest neighbourhood. Markers on the map will let you know about the people interested in paying you for doing some easy tasks like: household duties, taking out trash or mowing your lawn.
And if you're on the other side of the fence, there is no limit of markers on the map. Just describe your task, specify salary and wait for the response. And few hours later you can enjoy your freshly mowed lawn.
For further development we're thinking about implementing repetitive tasks (ex. doing shopping every Monday).
Another step will be implementing a rating system both for employees and employers. That will ensure that credibility of our service will be at the highest level.
